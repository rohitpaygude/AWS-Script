README :

This script will start/stop the EC2 instances based on the tags which they have.
If the instance has a tag "Auto On: True"(Case sensitive) it will start the instance.
If the instance has a tag "AutoOff: True"(Case sensitive) it will stop the instance.
This scripts we need to configure in a scheduler/crone.
